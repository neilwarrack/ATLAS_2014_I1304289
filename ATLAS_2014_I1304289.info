Description:
 "The normalized differential cross section for the top quark pair production is measured in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $7 \text{TeV}$. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of $4.6 fb^{-1}$, recorded in 2011. Events are selected in the lepton+jets channel, requiring exactly one lepton and at least four jets with at least one of the jets tagged as originating from a b-quark"

 - Implement the analysis, test it, remove this ToDo, and mark as VALIDATED :-)
